# lea's Portfolio Site
Hi, my name is lea. My background is in business analysis (and I took a little detour to user support for leadership experience) and data science. I truly love to make technology easier to use and understand. Thanks for stopping by my portfolio site, feel free to peruse my LinkedIn and my projects listed below.

## [Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Project - Coursera](https://leab38.github.io/cyclistic_capstone_google_cert/Cyclistic-Capstone-Markdown.html)
I have just completed the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) on Coursera and this is my final project (in the form of an R Markdown html page).

## [Booklovers Friend Capstone Project](https://github.com/leab38/Booklovers-friend)
My capstone for the [Data Incubator Data Science Fellowship](https://www.credly.com/badges/babdb93d-5a03-4c76-a8af-ec6464e11cdc/public_url) was building a site (using Python and SQL) dedicated to helping you figure out what to read next. This website uses two datasets to provide you with recommendations based on your location and your last "5 star" read.
